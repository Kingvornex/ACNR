# The Development Story of ACNR: A Journey of Passion and Growth

Let’s take a walk through the story of ACNR—a SA-MP server that started as a simple idea and grew into something truly special. It’s a tale of curiosity, challenges, and a whole lot of learning.

## How It All Began

When I first discovered SA-MP (San Andreas Multiplayer), I wasn’t a programmer. I was just a gamer who loved diving into **GTA: San Andreas**. The open world, the action, the creativity—it was everything I could ask for. Then came SA-MP, a multiplayer twist to my favorite game, and I was hooked.

At first, I played on different servers, exploring all the creative ways people were bringing this game to life. From roleplay to wild mini-games, it was fascinating. But soon, I started wondering: *How are these servers even made?* That question was the spark that kicked off my journey into server development.

## My First Steps

I had no idea where to start. I poked around the default gamemodes that came with the SA-MP server package. Then I dabbled with **filterscripts** and experimented with gamemodes created by others. Every small tweak and experiment taught me something new.

One day, I came across **NVCNR (New Vegas Cops and Robbers)**, a gamemode by **Weponz**. It was amazing—a well-designed script that made gameplay fun and engaging. But like all scripts, it wasn’t perfect. I noticed small bugs here and there, especially with commands. That’s when I decided to roll up my sleeves and try fixing them.

## Diving Deeper: Fixes and Features

Fixing bugs was tough, but also super rewarding. Over time, I got better at debugging and even started adding new features to improve the game. The journey from "I have no idea what I’m doing" to "Hey, this actually works!" was incredible. You can check out the changes I’ve made in the [ACNR Changelog](https://github.com/Kingvornex/ACNR-OPENMP/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### A Nod to NVCNR’s Roots

Before I got involved, NVCNR already had an impressive history. Created by Weponz in 2010, the gamemode had 13 major updates and grew from version **1.0** to **2.3**. In 2013, Weponz released the source code to the public, opening the doors for the community to take it further.

Here’s a quick timeline of its journey:
- **2010:** NVCNR launched by Weponz.
- **2012:** Development paused after version 2.3.
- **2013:** Source code released to the SA-MP forums.
- **2015–2016:** Weponz added small updates before officially ending support.

Another dev, **DopeX**, made his mark by transforming NVCNR into **ZCNR (Zeus Cops and Robbers)**. His updates included:
- Unlocking the map beyond Las Venturas.
- Keeping wanted levels after death.
- Adding cool features like gas tank explosions and revamped menus.

DopeX’s enthusiasm was infectious, and you could feel it in the comments he left in the code. Though he eventually moved on, his contributions left a lasting impact.

## ACNR is Born

In **2015**, I decided to take things further. I picked up where others had left off and rebranded the gamemode as **ACNR (Advanced Cops and Robbers)**. My goal? To keep the fun alive while introducing fresh updates. From **2015 to 2018**, I worked on enhancing ACNR. Life got busy, and I had to take a break for a few years, but the passion never left.

## A Fresh Start with Open.MP

In recent years, SA-MP officially stopped its updates, but the community wasn’t ready to say goodbye. That’s when **Open.MP** came into the picture, offering a new way to keep the multiplayer experience alive. Inspired by this, I got back to work, updating ACNR to make it compatible with Open.MP. The changelog is still growing as I add more improvements and ideas.

## Looking Back and Moving Forward

Working on ACNR has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. From being a curious gamer to a developer, it’s been a wild ride. I couldn’t have done it alone—shoutout to **Weponz**, **DopeX**, and the incredible SA-MP community for laying the foundation and inspiring me every step of the way.

As I look ahead, I’m excited to see what’s next for ACNR and the community that’s made it all possible. Here’s to many more years of creativity and collaboration!
